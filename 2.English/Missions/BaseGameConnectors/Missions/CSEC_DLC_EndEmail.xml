    <body>Agent,
    
You haven't been online for a while after accepting that Kaguya Trials job - anything we need to investigate?
If you've been taking a break to work on some other projects for a while, no problem. Your position at CSEC is safe and waiting for you whenever you want to pick up some jobs again.
