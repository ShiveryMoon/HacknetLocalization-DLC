Old school legendary target DigiPets has been given to the team as a test. Climb that mountain.
----
So, this wasn't my decision. We're nearly ready for the first of our two endgame jobs
A friend of mine has been doing a lot of digging for me to get us some starting points for something that I have in the works, but she's now asking for a show of confidence in the team.
Apparently not everyone just accepts that the three of you are the goods, so we've got some proving to do - and here we are.

Now, unfortunately, this network is no joke - it's a surprisingly legit litmus test of Hacker skill - so this is a team job, for #PLAYERNAME# and D3f4ult.

The task itself is to shuffle a few values on their mainframe's database - user "Minx" wants their value of "DigiPoints" set to anything over 1,000,000.

Stay sharp - this one's tricky.

      <note title="DigiPets Mission Guidelines">
Break the frontend web server and scan for nodes. Try not to cause damage there or it could alert network admins.
Locate the Mainframe and investigate the network until you find a way in.
Find file of user "Minx", and set "DigiPoints" to anything over 1,000,000
Verify change in database view.
