Hack a coffee shop to steal draft legislation from a frequent visitor's computer. We're not politically affiliated, of course - there's just a significant bounty on the information.
----
Asdis Dagrunsdottir, a European politician, has reportedly been secretly working within her party to draft legislation that could have an effect on how our industry does things. Hackers are curious folk, and, as such, there's a large bounty on it.

We've uncovered information that points to her being a frequent visitor at a cafe near her house. Fortunately, the cafe's router's IP address wasn't hard to find.

Find the files. Upload them to the drop server. I'll do the rest.
