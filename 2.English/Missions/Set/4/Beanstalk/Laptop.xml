Reminder that all sensitive data must be kept on LegiCloud - NO EXCEPTIONS. Party leadership is extremely clear on this.

To be even clearer: do NOT store files locally. Our partner governments have reported hackers using a mix of old and new techniques - spear phishing, brute force password cracking, and live memory dumping, just to name a few - but the majority of leaks come from negligence and user error.

dagrunsdottir: hi!
Manananggal: Hey there
dagrunsdottir: thanks for getting in contact
dagrunsdottir: my office sent me your details.
dagrunsdottir: so how can I help you?
Manananggal: it's pretty simple
Manananggal: I've got a copy of the new legislation
Manananggal: I understand that it's going to be pretty controversial, yes?
dagrunsdottir: what?
Manananggal: So I'm writing an article about it now.
Manananggal: Just wanted to get a clarification on the third part.
Manananggal: Hello?
dagrunsdottir: sorry, are you trying to blackmail me?
Manananggal: That's a bit uncharitable. I'm just trying to do my job
Manananggal: It seems like the third bit is unfinished, correct?
dagrunsdottir: I'm not interested in discussing this.
Manananggal: I guess I could just post the whole document, then
dagrunsdottir: please don't, I'd lose my seat
Manananggal: Let's chat then
Manananggal: Meet me two streets up from parliament. There's a cafe on the corner
dagrunsdottir: I know the one
dagrunsdottir: but if you try to blackmail me, I will report it and you *will* go to jail
Manananggal: Understood :)
