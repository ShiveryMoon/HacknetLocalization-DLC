D3f4ult had to leave the computer halfway through a hack, for personal reasons. Break into the target, finish the job, and clean up his work.
----
Personal issues have pulled D3f4ult AFK for a while mid-job. I need you to go back in there, clean up any traces of his work, and finish the job.

I'm looking for the unreleased projects of "Funkenstein" - home server attached. Download any that you find and upload them to the hub server.
Log from D3f4ult before he had to leave:

Kaguya: It's fine.
D3f4ult: Really am super sorry.
Kaguya: Don't beat yourself up over it
D3f4ult: These are the details:
D3f4ult: IP: 21.32.43.54
D3f4ult: login: admin
D3f4ult: pw: redwood
D3f4ult: I've already done the work on this system and a few others before it 
D3f4ult: so all you have to do is find the encrypted files, grab them, and put them on the dropbox
D3f4ult: The client said they were something about unreleased music?
D3f4ult: Also, I didn't get a chance to clean up my working files, so please do that for me

Good luck,
-Kaguya
