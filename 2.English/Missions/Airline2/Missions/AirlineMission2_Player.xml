Install a backdoor on a secure PacificAir link server
----
#PLAYERNAME#, your task is to secure us a backup plan, just incase my suspicions about Coel's job comes to fruition. If all goes well we wont even need it.
I've secured a piece of software that should allow us to hijack PacificAir's broadcast hardware. Their hardware is run by a computer they call the "Skylink" server. If you install this backdoor onto that server in the ~/sys/ folder, I can take care of the rest.

I've uploaded the backdoor you'll need to install to the home folder on the drop server. It's named "sysinfo.bat". Download that, find a way into the Skylink, and upload it to the sys folder, and I'll take care of the rest. No need to activate it.
Remember to be careful with your tracks - this isn't the time to get sloppy.

Good luck.
