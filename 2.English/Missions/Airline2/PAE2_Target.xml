  <!-- This is the most secure non-secret server in the DLC, and the final technically challenging hack the player must perform.
  It's only accessible once the player's broken into the whitelist server earlier, and their goal here is to upload a file they've been given
  from Kaguya into the sys folder.
  In cannon terms, the "skylink" is the server that manages all traffic from currently flying aircraft communicating with the internet or
  their own internal communications and tracking etc. This is the management and routing server of all active aircraft. By uploading the skylink jack
  here, Kaguya gets us access to live connections to actual flying aricraft.
