  <posting title="Hermetic Alchemists">
  An obscure branch of philosophy, the "Hermetic Alchemists" have a strangely substantial network set up. Some digging implies that their admin has been developing a tool we've wanted our hands on for some time.

It looks like this admin is some sort of trace tech prodigy, but is completely immersed in this alchemy business. Their network is a strange sort of fortress, but we really need to track down the home computer of this admin and get this software.

This is a team project - if you find anything helpful to the team, drop it into the chat.
Good luck.

      <note title="Hermetic Alchemists Contract">Investigate the network, and track down the home computer of the administrator.
From there, download the new trace tracking or prevention software, and upload it to the drop server.
