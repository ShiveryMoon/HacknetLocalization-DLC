The named was the mother of the myriad creatures. 
Hence always rid yourselves of desires 
In order to observe its secrets; 
But always allow yourself to have desires 
In order to observe its manifestations."

Vau, the third letter of the name of God, and the third branch of the Tree of Life.
The perspective shifts, and changes. What was mundane is now celestial. The wanderer opens her eyes, and sees the new.</file>

To create the new, one must
dissolve the old...
...and then...
...come together, as new.
This applies to both physical and metaphysical concepts; the idea is a broad one, steeped in history. 
It happens to many.
They don't even realize it's happening, sometimes.

  <!-- This needs to be re-worked - the word clarity should be replaced with a riddle witha  similar length word as the solution.
  Let me know the riddle/solution, and i'll implement it. Make sure it's *very* clear what the answer should be if the player has
  been reading along etc as they go, and ideally, provide hints for a way to work it out with only the stuff on this computer, but
  the true answer should be hinted at in another server's filename, and more details inside. Note that the contents of this will be 
  relayed to the player through the IRC system, not directly readmost of the time (but will be sometimes).-->
