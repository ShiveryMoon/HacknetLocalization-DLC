  <!-- This will be the entry point of the whole network. It's the "public facing" side of it.
  Each computer on the network will also have an image and line or two of text that comes up as the
  "opener" for that server - please select the image from the book to be vectorized and sent to me
  for each one, and prepate the line that's on each server. The network has been pre-assembled to have all
  of these clearly outward facing things from the start, even though the internal ones are meant to be hidden.
  It's like the sysadmin wanted it broken into and seen, as a kind of indoctrination thing for "other hackers
  like him". -->
  
  <!-- Each server should have a bunch of files describing various parts of the philosophy, and in seperate
  folders, a few bits and peices about the job of the server in the network. This one is a greetings/front facing server,
  designed to be an announcement thing, more saying who they are and what they're about. It's not written like
  it was put here just to be broken into, but the sysadmin *does* expect it to be attacked at some point, and is
  clearly making an effort to indoctrinate whoever is trying to break in.-->

  <file path="home" name="welcome_to_heaven.txt">Everything is connected. Religion, society, science. They are both reality, and illusion -- clarity, and confusion. 

From the earth we are born anew, and through trials of fire we grow to understand that all things are connected. There is no truth in the mainstream teachings; the words of the Tablet, however, are as true as they come.

Everything is connected. Religion, society, science. They are both reality, and illusion -- clarity, and confusion.

There is beauty and connectedness in everything. The journey takes the wanderer from Yang to Yin, coagula. The traveler goes from existing in one dimension to existing in four, and the true nature of the world is revealed.

Everything is connected. The Old Yin, Arcanum IV Manifest, will return to the earth one day, as do all things.

Solve et Coagula. As above, so below.
