A relativley unknown Hacker 'Striker' has reputedly built a very nice memory dump generator. We'd like a copy.
----
The target's system is relativley well defended, but nothing you shouldn't be able to handle. I'd like this job to be as clean as possible - no unnecessary destruction or trouble if you can manage it.
Grab a copy of the memory dump generator and upload it to the hub drop server.

Good Luck,
