  <!-- This server is part of the security system the external contractors "Psylance" put in place
  Connections to the critical servers (Bookings mainframe, mail, and this one) are automatically denied
  unless they're on the whitelist, hosted on this server.
  
  Shortly after the player gets here, Coel or Default will work their magic to disable it.
  Alt plan is to add the team's IP's to the list, but that involves a lot of extras
  (making comps for Coel/default if the player follows the lead, scan being less elegant,
  someone needing to delete those entries after mission is over. Desirables, if I have time)
  
  This means that this computer contains a list of external IPs of employee home computers that can access it.
  Scanning will reveal all of these, as a shortcut.
  
  It should contain a few technical documents explaining what it does, and a few notes from the Psylance staff about
  people who want access etc, and a copy+paste message they can use to deny people.
