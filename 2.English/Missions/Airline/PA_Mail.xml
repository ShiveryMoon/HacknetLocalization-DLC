I asked someone to do something on my laptop and one of them just FLIPPED OUT. Got me to change my password immediately and everything.
I just added a 1 to the end of it, so it shouldn't be too hard to remember, but still, pretty frustrating.
What's their deal?

I asked around and apparently you're the best person to talk to about this.
I received an email about a password reset and I'm not sure if it's real. Can you verify?

I must request that you please keep the contents of your emails strictly business related. This one seems like a personal complaint, and it's unprofessional.
Thanks!

    <email recipient="awilburn" sender="dwiklowski" subject="Office Lottery">Hey everyone! Just wanted to let you all know that the office lottery's delayed - Anthony hasn't gone and bought the iPad yet, so there's... no point in running it yet, y' know? Anyway, it's still happening, but since it's a busy time of year, we might have to wait a couple of weeks.
Best, Dan
P.S. Congrats to Marta and Benita on the birth of their adorable baby boy! Hope to see you both soon!</email>

    <email recipient="awilburn" sender="jadams" subject="Meeting Thursday">Alexina,
Fun little FYI: You're absolutely in the running for Employee of the Month.
On that subject, we're having a meeting on Thursday to decide the Employee of the Month. I trust I'll see you there?

Hi, everyone! Brandi here. This email contains information and clarifications on your yearly travel entitlements.
As I'm sure you're all aware, we've had to let some people go this year. This is a part of our round of belt-tightening across the entire company - our CEO even took a pay cut to lessen the effect of *your* pay cuts, to give you an idea.
Anyway, the free travel program for mid-level-and-above Pacific Air employees is being extensively modified to remove ambiguities and make it simpler for low-level employees to be inducted into the program.
You can find out all the details on the company portal, under ""NEWS"".
Let me know if you have any questions
Best,
Brandi From HR</email>
