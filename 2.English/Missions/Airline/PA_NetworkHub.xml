  <!-- Network hub for the airline. This is an "internal Services" node for the airline,
  it runs misc services and hosts data for them. This sort of catch-all, "don't know
  where to put it so just put it there" server exists *a lot* in corporate networks.
  Because of it's generic nature, it's the easy answer to where things go, so it naturally
  becomes the center of things over time.
  
  Mechanically, it mostly exists to provide a central point from which players can reference things,
  and for players to feel like the network is big and expansive, when not everything has a specialized role.
  
  In terms of the files it'll have on it, probably a few memos from people to one another (and another one
  complaining that they should just use the company email for that sort of thing), bits and pieces that
  employees want to send each other, or be able to access at work, both personal and work-related.
  We don't want players to spend too long here (there isn't anything too useful to the mission to find) so keep
  it light.-->

Over the past few days, i've...
Grown to understand some things
Really, it's a long process
If i've caused trouble, sorry!
For you, i'm sure it's frustrating
Finbow-senpai, please forgive me!
In any case, it's a long process, like i said.
Never mind the overtime I've been doing! ha ha!
Keen to start over with a clean slate? :)
I'd like to try!
Same rules apply.
Soon we'll grab coffee and it'll be cool.
Mind the step!
Yell at me again, go for it.
Anyway, I wanted to wrap this one up.
So I'll finish up this memo and get back to work.
Say, uh, why don't you try reading the first letter of each sentence? -nat</file>

  <file path="home/share" name="underwater.txt">"Look here, old man; what do you say about having a shot for the Naval Reserve?" asked Ross. "In ordinary circs I would be prepared to go through Sandhurst, but this isn't ordinary circs. Before we pass out, the war will be over perhaps."

"I'd rather like to see something of the fun," agreed Vernon.

"As if we hadn't already," added his chum. "But I know what you mean. Instead of being cooped up in an unterseeboot and hunted by our fellows, we want to have a hand in rounding up the German submarines. I vote we write to our respective governors about it."</file>
