Gain access to the bookings mainframe of an international airline.
----
To get straight to the point, for some future safeguarding projects, I need access to the bookings mainframe of the international airline "Pacific Air".

I've been looking into this already, and have some solid leads. We already know the IP address of the Bookings Mainframe itself - unfortunately getting in isn't going to be that simple.
It's protected by not only exceptional security, but also a dedicated whitelist server. It'll deny connections outright from all external sources, including us. We'll need to use an alternative entry point into the network (provided) to find a way around this, and a way in.

The network is run by the Psylance Cyber Security group, so expect a challenge, and cover your tracks at all points.

Once you've found a way in, include the administrator password of the bookings mainframe in your mission completion details.
Good luck.
