PortSmacker is a tool intended for speeding up your torrents by using nontraditional ports to punch through ISP-level NAT throttling and firewalls.

The user interface mimics a spreadsheet; to change a setting, just type a number in a cell and hit Enter. This tool is intended for advanced users, so don't fuck it up.

Example Usage:

I want to speed up my torrents, but port 6881 is throttled by my ISP. To get around that, I drop down to port 8, which, for some reason, works much better. Eventually the ISP will get wise, and start throttling port 8, but until then, it's fine to keep using it.
