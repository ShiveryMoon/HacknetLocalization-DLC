  <!-- This is the endpoint server that is the ultimate goal of the mission.
  Is has security that's too advanced for the player to break into by force,
  but also has an option on it to reset the password, which emails the new
  password to the administrator. This is how the player breaks in.
  It isn't built to be investigated much, so doesn't need many files.-->
