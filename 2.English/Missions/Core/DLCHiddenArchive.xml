Navigate to the folder containing the memory dump you want to analyze.
Run the command:
MemForensics [FILENAME]
Remember you can use TAB to autocomplete filenames and paths.
It will take a while to process (index) the dump, then you'll be provided with the scan tooling.
Each option will process the memory and attempt to pick out relevant data.
There is no cost, or danger of tracing etc involved, as the tools will not execute any memory - just read and print it.

        <Block>Notes on SNACKINTOSH, ongoing investigation for TemplarSecurityNet by @alidaxavier22
        
Real name(s?):
Vita Prendergast - found on IP connected to her email address
Maia Burgess - name connected to Vita with no other available records
Hikari Krizan - same as above (are these throwaway identities?)
Rose Ishikawa - a "friend of hers" who my darknet contact mentioned

Occupation:
She's big in the hacker scene. But not... popular? Powerful.
Fingerprints in many places. More than she realizes. Many date back to a few years ago. Negligence? Intentional negligence? Breadcrumbs for those who wish to find her? (Oh god, am I Hacker Hansel?)
As far as I can tell, she makes things. Tools maybe? In the *one* public discussion I found, people went completely silent when she started talking about toolchains and assembly coding. Worth pursuing.

Known IPs:
143.78.36.213 - NOW DEFUNCT - connected to a public dropbox with this
219.242.177.14 - NOW DEFUNCT - connected to our chat with this
39.46.123.206 - NOW DEFUNCT - her proxy?
185.160.171.69 - probably dead? - her proxy behind the first proxy? I paid someone to break through the first one. Don't know how to get into this one. Need to buy new tools from HackerForums.

Contact details:
Hell if I know. I was able to chat with her, through our mutual contact, but she didn't seem interested in making contact again. I guess she'll find me if she wants to talk more.

Ongoing plans: 
-keep doing stuff
-pursue someone else idk
-die

Acknowledged.
Operation Barter Economy.
-: Really?
The goal is to nab the software, modify it so nobody realizes we're reselling it, and then profit a whole bunch. Addi is in charge of reverse engineering. Ani, contacting buyers. Simon, cleaning up the money. 
-: ?
Don't be a shit, Simon.
-: I'm good at contacting buyers too.
Yes, but Ani is better. Let him handle it.
-: Fine. Are you sure you can handle *this*, though?
One hundred percent. I've got all my tools in order.
Simon. What's the status of our acquisition?
-: In progress. Will keep you updated.
Thanks. Do we have anything to worry about?
-: No. I'm confident that we do not.
How confident?
-: Confident enough.
Keep it that way. Talk later.
-: Don't let Ani fuck this up.
I won't.</Block>

        <Block>Two people walk onto an airplane, hand in hand.
One is a black-hearted grocer.
One is a free-flying florist.
After the plane lands, one leaves, carrying a briefcase.
Who is it?

What happens when you throw a volcano at a regretful koala in a tree?
It is a fridge.

*extremely Jerry Seinfeld voice* I'd buy that for a Malaysian Ringgit!

I heard a story about three corgis: one round, one phlegmatic, one emptied of all its rounds. They walk into a bar. Behind the bar is a young woman with a smoking habit. In the corner of the bar, a retired professional wrestler is grappling with a knight in a helmet. What happens next?

A person has a shoe on his head. He creates stories of old. He owns a moody creature that lives in a shell. Who is he?

In a cold place there is a weaver of wonders in many lands. This person is a swashbuckler. This person wears a sword. This person never lies.
Who is she?

  <!-- False report for Psylance CSEC Injected mission -->
  <encryptedFile path="home" name="PA_0022_Incident.dec" ip="54.183.231.31" header="Psylance Incident Report v2">
Psylance Cyber Security - internal investigations division.
---------------------------------------

Investigations into the sudden equipment failure aboard Pacific Air Flight PA_0022 are ongoing, but preliminary reports show it to be caused by a glitch in the firmware of the plane itself.
Psylance servers remain secure and show no deviations from expected behavior during the incident (infact, this incident shows promising application of the remote monitoring capabilities of the skylink and related servers - lower latency than was originally predicted!).

The firmware incident itself seems to be based in 747FlightOps.dll - in which under currently unknown rare circumstances the firmware will stop responding to pilot controls and require a firmware reboot (which we can see happened in this case successfully).
Psylance recommends investigating the software providers behind this module, and instructing all pilots on safe firmware reboot procedure for the rare case in which this might happen in the interim.

As always, Psylance Cyber Security holds the security of your data, records and safety in the highest regard. We will continue monitoring the situation to ensure that your networks are safe and secure in this delicate time.
