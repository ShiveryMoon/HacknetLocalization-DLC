A mission starts with a tag saying mission, like this:

<mission id="airline_player">

There are nly a select few tags you need to translate in missions, so i'll go through all of them. Do not translate anything not mentioned here.

In missions, you want to look for the tag "posting", like this:

<posting title="Take Flight - #PLAYERNAME#">
Gain access to the bookings mainframe of an international airline.
</posting>

Translate the title (remember to keep names and formatting intact!) and the body of the posting.

Then address the email tag. Translate the Sender, subject and body of the email.

Look to the attachments tag and look for any "note" tags inside that.
Translate the title and body of any notes.

That's it!
