Hi all,

I got linked this and thought the group should know. Looks like it's someone pulling a team together and running recruitment tests. 
If anyone's interested in some new projects, it might be worth checking out - I took a look, but don't really have time for that sort of thing right now.
Does anyone know who this "Kaguya" person is? The name's new to me.

At any rate, here's the link - keep fighting the good fight,
