    <body>Hi,
    
Welcome back. Something new's come up that a lot of groups are interested in. Entropy and CSEC both have agents after it, but I thought you'd want to check it out too.

First though, lets get you back up to speed. This VM should have SSHCrack and FTPBounce preloaded on it - just break into the linked server and download the file in ~/bin and we'll move on. I think you'll like it.

Once you're done, I've got something from Tex to forward you.
I hope you're still sharp - you're going to need it.
-Matt
