  <!-- This is the second DLC intro server, that gives the player the intro exe that wipes their mail icon
  It's designed to be pretty empty - it's a recruitment server that's designed to be hackable and targeted,
  but Kaguys is pretty dilligent and wipes it often. The sort of people that will be trying this are a higher
  class of Hacker too, so not as much vandalism. Mostly clean, I think - maybe just a single note or so in
  a different folder?-->

I am Kaguya, and I am forming a team.
Elites only, all resources shared, building towards big things.
Interested applicants can apply via the executable here.
Running this program constitutes an agreement to be tested,

Good luck.

I've heard your team fights for justice, for what is right. 
Help me Kaguya, you are my only hope.
Some script kiddie fucks have infected my parents network, taking with them all of our banking details, passport information, and our life savings. 
We were saving for years to finally leave this dump and make our way to the US. 
I'm sure our passport information has already been sold in some black market deal, and as for our money, it's long gone.
I need someone to help. Pls.
I'm no 1337 hacker, but I thought you guys would help.
Pls?
