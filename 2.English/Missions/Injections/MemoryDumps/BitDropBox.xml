----------------

My head feels heavy.
It's not just.... facing all of this, even. There's so much to do, so little time for it, and so, so many places where it could all just not work.
Yet, I cant even test it properly. It doesn't make sense to me - I know I should be able to just boot this up, see it on my screen and test it, make *sure* it works, just...
Cant do it. It's like... a more powerful version of "I don't feel like it", it's something a bit more than that.
I don't understand this feeling.
I notice that I am confused.

I don't know how to test this, or measure it.
No time to think in circles. It'll work. Keep going.
Sort out this feeling if... it turns out I didn't need this stuff..
