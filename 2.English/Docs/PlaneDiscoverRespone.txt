Hey,

So you'd be the hacker behind the whole Pacific Flight PA_0022 incident huh?
You left some logs on one of the planes. Don't worry, I've cleared it up for you, but that's really not the sort of thing to be careless with. Pro tip.

I decided to go digging into that whole thing a bit - suspected some foul play and all, and boy was there.  I found out about Nisei Mk3 - some reports on the second flight. I'm guessing you and your group are why I can't find any actual files on how to produce it - just the test reports huh.
Good thing too - that stuff sounds nasty. Don't need more of that in the world.

Stay safe out there. Love your work, but you wont always have a stranger watching your back.
