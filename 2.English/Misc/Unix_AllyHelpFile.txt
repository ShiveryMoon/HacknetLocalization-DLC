-- VM Bootloader Trap Repair Guide --

1: If you don't have one already, open a terminal near where the blocking file will be. The folder changes from system to system, but you should be looking near where your VM stores it's data files.

2: Move through folders to find the offending file. You're looking for "VMBootloaderTrap.dll".

I recommend using "ls" right away, and every time you change directories so you don't lose track of where you are.

Don't forget ".." to go back.

3: Once you've found VMBootloaderTrap.dll, you'll need to release the permissions lock on it before you can delete it.

Run this:
chmod +rw Injections
chmod +rw Injections/VMBootloaderTrap.dll


4: Now delete it!


5: Start up your VM again and get going.
