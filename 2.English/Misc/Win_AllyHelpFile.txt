-- VM Bootloader Trap Repair Guide --

1: If you don't have one already, open a command prompt near where the blocking file will be.
(I've copied over a shortcut script that should do this called "OpenCMD.bat" - running that will work). 
It changes from system to system, but you should be looking near where your VM stores it's data files.

2: Move through folders to find the offending file. You're looking for "VMBootloaderTrap.dll".
Note for Windows:

linux | windows
cd    =   cd
ls    =   dir
rm    =   del

I recommend using "dir" right away, and every time you change directories so you don't lose track of where you are. 
Don't forget ".." to go back. Tab will autocomplete file and folder names in Windows, but not commands!


3: Once you've found VMBootloaderTrap.dll, you'll need to release the permissions lock on it before you can delete it.

Run this:
icacls VMBootloaderTrap.dll /grant USERS:D


4: Now delete it!


5: Start up your VM again and get going.
