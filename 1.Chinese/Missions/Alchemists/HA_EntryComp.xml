  <!-- This will be the entry point of the whole network. It's the "public facing" side of it.
  Each computer on the network will also have an image and line or two of text that comes up as the
  "opener" for that server - please select the image from the book to be vectorized and sent to me
  for each one, and prepate the line that's on each server. The network has been pre-assembled to have all
  of these clearly outward facing things from the start, even though the internal ones are meant to be hidden.
  It's like the sysadmin wanted it broken into and seen, as a kind of indoctrination thing for "other hackers
  like him". -->
  
  <!-- Each server should have a bunch of files describing various parts of the philosophy, and in seperate
  folders, a few bits and peices about the job of the server in the network. This one is a greetings/front facing server,
  designed to be an announcement thing, more saying who they are and what they're about. It's not written like
  it was put here just to be broken into, but the sysadmin *does* expect it to be attacked at some point, and is
  clearly making an effort to indoctrinate whoever is trying to break in.-->

  <file path="home" name="welcome_to_heaven.txt">万物皆有联系。宗教、社会、科学。它们亦真亦幻——清晰又捉摸不定。

我们生在大地，经历火的考验，然后逐渐明白，万物都有联系。主流学说并非真实，而碑文所述是真正的真实。

万物皆有联系。宗教、社会、科学。它们亦真亦幻——清晰又捉摸不定。

万物皆美丽而相互关联。凝结带着迷失者从阳到阴。旅人从一维存在变成四维，而世界的真实本质得以揭开。

万物皆有联系。奥秘IV：显露的古阴终将重现于世，万物亦如此。

分解和重组生命。天上如是，地下亦然。
